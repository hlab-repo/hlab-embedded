  * ask Betsy for article on laser scanning
  * 2 weeks to gather data and 4 months to complie 
* to scale of 'original' monument
* 8 wanted to make as "place like" as possible - forget they are in Tink
  * this is strange use of MR, seems more like VR?
* 5 class sessions - first as introduction to APP about 1.5 hours a piece
* students surprised by the scale and complexity
* students loved the rising levels etc. 
* 'best of both worlds' cause scaffolding not in the way
* want to extend experience beyond Case and Higher Ed
* you can be differently present due to comfort
* HoloLens could provide a bit of a social buffer to enable more willingness to participate in group work

Questions
* how did HoloLens foster sense of togetherness in the space?
