Before I even began learning Unity, the programming space that is most often used to create objects and experiences for the Hololens, putting the lens on made me think about horizon and what it means to have a private or shared horizon of view. The lens offers digital objects into my horizon of view. The physical space I am in also offers objects into this horizon, which others in the space share with me. The interactions of these materialities within this horizon seems to be what mixed reality is promising. This idea of horizon could be an organizing feature for the development of these tools since the empty project canvas in Unity is a representation of a horizon.

The overlap of materialities and intersection of horizons here in Unity and Hololens has some connection to the ways in which we think about meaning and interpretation. Here we invite Gadamer into the conversation...
