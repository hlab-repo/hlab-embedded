## Allienation?

* insular view of world - nobody else sees what I see, where is interactivity?
* does the digital overlay/mixedness allienate me from myself or perhaps from the patient on the operating table?

## Simondon on alienation

My encounters of alienation in Simondon's _modes of existence_ :

Alienation looms large in Simondon's _On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects_. Even his short summary of the work mentions alienation several times. From this short summary, we see that Simondon hopes to push beyond economic and psychological framings of human alienation to explore the alienation enacted in technology. Moving beyond an instrumental notion of technical objects as simply tools for use or consumption, Simondon begs philosophy to reimagine a relationship between humans and technical objects that could alleviate alienation in both. 

Straight away in his introduction, Simondon attacks the binary between human (culture) and machine (technics) and argues that this binary, rooted in a fear of the foreign, is actually the root of alienation (15-16).

Simondon elaborates on alienation in his discussion of the _transindividual_. This suggestion of the _transindividual_ is located in a conversation about work and the distinction between employment/work and invention. At the risk of oversimplifying, this part of Simondon's discussion sounds to me a bit like Drucker's call to humanities scholars to help us move interface design from simply considering "users" as consumers to reintegrating a complex and coconstructed notion of subject into our design. A consisten refrain in this concluding section is pushing the distinction between an object as simply useful and its potential to be technical (which is not reducible to tool or use). The move from utensil to technical object demands a relationship, which is _transindividuality_ (253).

> This section makes me wonder what the intersections might be between transindividuality and multiplicity in Bergson. I also wonder what the connections might be between Simondon's resistence of the reduction to work and discussions of work in Levinas _Totality and Infinity_?

Section 337 and 338 (253-254) are where Simondon takes up alienation explicitly. From this short section, it sounds like Simondon is suggesting that the transindividual collective is the pathway toward reducing alienation. The economic (Marx) and the psychological (counter-Marx) approaches to resisting alienation miss the point that WORK is the source of alienation, not something outside of work. This pushes us to be sure we are clear on how we are reading "work" here in Simondon. My intuition reads this work as a form of efficient instrumentality and can be applied to either objects or subjects/humans. Hence, the distinction between "the social" and "the transindividual collective" for Simondon (254).

> "The technical activity distinguishes itself from mere work, and from alienating work, in that technical activity comprises not only the use of the machine, but also a certain coefficient of attention to the technical functioning, maintenance, adjustment, and improvement of the machine, which continues the activity of invention and construction" (255).

So, technical activity (which is NOT simply use or work) demands a partnership between human and machine characterized by attention and adjustment, not simply use. Alienation occurs whith reduced attention. So, the tendency for emerging technologies to make themselves "invisible" is precisely what reinforces the potential for alienation. Thus, foregrounding attention to the material entanglements between humans and machines is key to resisting alienation. 

> His point about maintenance continuing the process of invention/genesis/construction could provide a nice theoretical framework for the discussion about sustainability we had in the Mellon workshops. Often, grants fund the creation of new technologies, but do not fund the maintenance of them, because this is not as flashy or sexy. Here, Simondon makes a clear argument that WITHOUT maintenance, there is no relationship of attention between machine and human and thus we reduce the technology to an economic object made for efficient consumption and subject to rapid decay. Maintenance as the ongoing process of making through attention and adjustment constitutes the technical relation and thus resists alienation. 

Ok, I think the challenge to Marxist economic alienation gets clearer on 256, where Simondon makes quite a statement, "to possess a machine is not to know it" (256). he does suggest that lack of possession or ownership can increase the distance between machine and user, thus making the alienation through non attentive use/work more plausible.
