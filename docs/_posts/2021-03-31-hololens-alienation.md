## Alienation and the HoloLens

One of the questions that often emerges around humans relating with technology is whether a particular technology encourages an unwanted distance from the material world, from social engagement, from difference, or from oneself.

In particular, with the HoloLens, we have wondered if the focus on efficient access to layers of data provided in a largely isolated and individualistic visual field could create possible tendencies toward alienation from other people (I see a mixed world that I can not share with anyone else), from the physical materiality of the objects entangled in the view (a hologram of a heart located above a patient could distance the lens wearer from attention to the body on the operating table), or from self (I use the lens without active participation in challenging its possibilities and limits). 

With the application of HoloLens technologies in domains such as education and healthcare and military, these questions of alienation become rather important. In our research, we have found an important connection between efficiency based or predominantly instrumental relationships with technology and the tendency toward these forms of alienation. In our embedded h.lab model, we would bring backward design thinking to bear on the selection of and engagement with technologies for a project to foreground the guiding goals and values of a project and then to evaluate the technological relationships with respect to these goals and values. 

> Notice the language of "engagement with technology" above. We are actively resisting reductive instrumental notions of our relationship with technology through avoiding langauge of "use" or "tools" whenever possible. 

For example, getting clarity on the distinction between training and education and on the different goals of these activities can provide excellent guidelines for how researchers and participants can more actively and intentionally engage with the technologies that are a part of the project's ensemble. 

Below, we share some reflections on our encounters with alienation in our research.

## Simondon on Alienation

My encounters of alienation in Simondon's _modes of existence_ :

Alienation looms large in Simondon's _On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects_. Even his short summary of the work mentions alienation several times. From this short summary, we see that Simondon hopes to push beyond economic and psychological framings of human alienation to explore the alienation enacted in technology. Moving beyond an instrumental notion of technical objects as simply tools for use or consumption, Simondon begs philosophy to reimagine a relationship between humans and technical objects that could alleviate alienation in both. 

Straight away in his introduction, Simondon attacks the binary between human (culture) and machine (technics) and argues that this binary, rooted in a fear of the foreign, is actually the root of alienation (15-16).

Simondon elaborates on alienation in his discussion of the _transindividual_. This suggestion of the _transindividual_ is located in a conversation about work and the distinction between employment/work and invention. At the risk of oversimplifying, this part of Simondon's discussion sounds to me a bit like Drucker's call to humanities scholars to help us move interface design from simply considering "users" as consumers to reintegrating a complex and coconstructed notion of subject into our design. A consisten refrain in this concluding section is pushing the distinction between an object as simply useful and its potential to be technical (which is not reducible to tool or use). The move from utensil to technical object demands a relationship, which is _transindividuality_ (253).

> This section makes me wonder what the intersections might be between transindividuality and multiplicity in Bergson. I also wonder what the connections might be between Simondon's resistence of the reduction to work and discussions of work in Levinas _Totality and Infinity_?

Section 337 and 338 (253-254) are where Simondon takes up alienation explicitly. From this short section, it sounds like Simondon is suggesting that the transindividual collective is the pathway toward reducing alienation. The economic (Marx) and the psychological (counter-Marx) approaches to resisting alienation miss the point that WORK is the source of alienation, not something outside of work. This pushes us to be sure we are clear on how we are reading "work" here in Simondon. My intuition reads this work as a form of efficient instrumentality and can be applied to either objects or subjects/humans. Hence, the distinction between "the social" and "the transindividual collective" for Simondon (254).

> "The technical activity distinguishes itself from mere work, and from alienating work, in that technical activity comprises not only the use of the machine, but also a certain coefficient of attention to the technical functioning, maintenance, adjustment, and improvement of the machine, which continues the activity of invention and construction" (255).

So, technical activity (which is NOT simply use or work) demands a partnership between human and machine characterized by attention and adjustment, not simply use. Alienation occurs whith reduced attention. So, the tendency for emerging technologies to make themselves "invisible" is precisely what reinforces the potential for alienation. Thus, foregrounding attention to the material entanglements between humans and machines is key to resisting alienation. 

> His point about maintenance continuing the process of invention/genesis/construction could provide a nice theoretical framework for the discussion about sustainability we had in the Mellon workshops. Often, grants fund the creation of new technologies, but do not fund the maintenance of them, because this is not as flashy or sexy. Here, Simondon makes a clear argument that WITHOUT maintenance, there is no relationship of attention between machine and human and thus we reduce the technology to an economic object made for efficient consumption and subject to rapid decay. Maintenance as the ongoing process of making through attention and adjustment constitutes the technical relation and thus resists alienation. 

Ok, I think the challenge to Marxist economic alienation gets clearer on 256, where Simondon makes quite a statement, "to possess a machine is not to know it" (256). he does suggest that lack of possession or ownership can increase the distance between machine and user, thus making the alienation through non attentive use/work more plausible.
