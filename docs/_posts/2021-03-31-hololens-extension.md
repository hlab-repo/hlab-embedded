My favorite feature of the lens so far is the extended touch tool. talk about reaching for distant ibjects and then washing with digital overlay.

* Extending vision with cameras 
* extending touch in some ways - long reach
* reproducing basic interfaces like mouse and keyboard - is this a limitation of imagination or more about working with user dispositions?
