When I watched the video below about the release of Microsoft's new Hololens 2, I was very excited to get my hands on one.

Thanks to h.lab at Case Western Reserve University, our team is getting a chance to explore the Hololens and its participation in the emerging field of mixed reality. We will have much to say about Hololens as a participant in mixed reality, but here, I simply want to share some of my initial impressions of the Hololens experience.

## Materialities

* head unit suprisingly comfortable. very happy to have no weight resting on bridge of nose
* difficult to resist a consistent move of the gaze upward
* graphics lacking at best
* Lateral movement not well synched with displays


## Extension 

* Extending vision with cameras 
* extending touch in some ways - long reach
* reproducing basic interfaces like mouse and keyboard - is this a limitation of imagination or more about working with user dispositions?

## Mixed?

* on the one hand, the headset DOES allow me to use my hands/fingers as a mouse, so in a way this is mixing my physical materiality with the 3d digital objects in the view
* ? could we call the view of the lens as an horizon?
* Yet, when playing with 3d holograms, they did NOT interact with the physical world around me. e.g. elephant on pogo stick does not notice top of my daughters head
* Feels more like overlays of screens, hearkening back to old notions of mixed reality, than it does to a robust entanglement of material embodiments. 

### Horizon

Before I even began learning Unity, the programming space that is most often used to create objects and experiences for the Hololens, putting the lens on made me think about horizon and what it means to have a private or shared horizon of view. The lens offers digital objects into my horizon of view. The physical space I am in also offers objects into this horizon, which others in the space share with me. The interactions of these materialities within this horizon seems to be what mixed reality is promising. This idea of horizon could be an organizing feature for the development of these tools since the empty project canvas in Unity is a representation of a horizon.

The overlap of materialities and intersection of horizons here in Unity and Hololens has some connection to the ways in which we think about meaning and interpretation. Here we invite Gadamer into the conversation...

## Allienation?

* insular view of world - nobody else sees what I see, where is interactivity?
* does the digital overlay/mixedness allienate me from myself or perhaps from the patient on the operating table?
