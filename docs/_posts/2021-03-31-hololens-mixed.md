## In what ways are "realities" mixed in the Hololens?

* on the one hand, the headset DOES allow me to use my hands/fingers as a mouse, so in a way this is mixing my physical materiality with the 3d digital objects in the view
* Yet, when playing with 3d holograms, they did NOT interact with the physical world around me. e.g. elephant on pogo stick does not notice top of my daughters head
* Feels more like overlays of screens, hearkening back to old notions of mixed reality, than it does to a robust entanglement of material embodiments.
