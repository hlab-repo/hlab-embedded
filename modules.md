	1.	HISTORY [of the tech / catchy title?]
	⁃	go back at least to Englebart & early patents/ideas & NATO dox
	⁃	1990s into now, incl. vocab defining dox re VR / AR / MR
	⁃	[here or where?] "critical VR theory"? white body supremacy / history of hegemonic gaze (matrix of domination) / presumed white euro male POV / Ux … How deeply embedded is it? How structural / integral to the whole thing?

	2.	REALITY [real/virtual … catchy title?]
	⁃	embodiments - different not less than or simulated or virtual
	⁃	translation / translating space
	⁃	what does mixed mean?
	⁃	POV inside space, subjected to it vs outside subject looking at & manipulating object

	⁃	experience of self and the world: how does tech always shape that interface?

	3.	EDUCATION ["Creating Space"?]
	⁃	training vs other ideas of education [training = banking model; Chomsky: training citizens / control … no questions] 
	⁃	ed as creating space for connection = vulnerability / hospitality
	⁃	What are the strategies for facilitating such connectivity with HL in the classroom and agency … liberation (HL can create an isolated world / isolation, and can diminish the agency of the learner, and limiting access [re both disability and economic access])
	⁃	How to use existing tech like HL with the above educational goals in mind? [how dialectically / interactively / relationally … perversely … that can speak to education as connection, liberation,
	⁃	here to learn together, "heterodidacticism" - Freire, Tompkins, Hare and Setiya
	⁃	learning to raise a real question / to question = vulnerability
	⁃	praxis (h.lab principles; Friere)
	⁃	individual vs collaborative
	⁃	ritual

	⁃	How do I maintain control of my reality / sense? 
	⁃	Privacy? 
	⁃	Data (and experience) ownership? 


	5.	HUMAN-TECH [or merge with "reality" module with a unifying theme/title?] 
	⁃	contextualize with broader field of evolution of human-tech (Simondon, Stiegler, etc.)
	⁃	instrumental fallacy … prevalent and a total dead end … How to avoid reducing either humans or machines to passive tools / instruments?
	⁃	non neutrality of techs (Hayles, Bishop, …)
	⁃	How do we conceive and identify points / moments of intervention and innovation within such complex, emergent systems from within them, as part of them?
	⁃	Alongside human-machine symbiosis (HFi), can we also explore sustainable human-machine community?
